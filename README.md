Real-Time Weapon Detection for Surveillance using YOLOv8

This project detects weapons (knife, pistol, rifle, etc.) in real-time from a live webcam feed using YOLOv8 and OpenCV. On detection, it captures the frame with bounding boxes, sends an email alert with the annotated image, and logs the event with a timestamp.

ðŸ“Œ Current Features:
Real-time detection via webcam
Sends email alerts with detected weapon images
Saves annotated frames with bounding boxes
Maintains detection logs with timestamps

ðŸš€ Future Scope:
Integration with IP/CCTV cameras
Dashboard for multi-camera monitoring
Deployment on edge devices like Raspberry Pi
SMS/Push notifications integration

ðŸ”’ Use Case: Security monitoring, restricted area surveillance, border security, home safety systems.
